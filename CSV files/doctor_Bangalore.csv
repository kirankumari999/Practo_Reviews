The Medicines made her condition worse, that's where I decided to move to another hospital and Manipal was the first preferred choice. Dr Pankaj with initial examination scrapped the previous medicines and confirmed with super confidence that he'll take only 5 days to treat her.She was admitted and started with another treatment course and got discharged on the 5th day and it has been 3-4 months and she is perfectly fine now.I was amazed and speechless with gratitude. ** ** ****** * ***** ****** *** *** * ****** *********** ",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"Being close to his lunch time, the doctor didn't spent enough time listening to the problem and hurried into everything. In general also, the medicine he gave didn't help at all and we had to visit someone else the next week. Turned out to be waste of money because the following week, we had to pay the consultation fee again. Will not recommend visiting him. Note that, this doctor doesn't sit in the designated speciality department but is a general physician who also looks at endocrinology cases.",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"This was my worst experience ever with any doctor. I hardly remember him enquiring about the issue and mostly he was stuck to his PC and making non-sense list of medicines I should take.All the hard medicines he gave caused severe ulcer in my oesophagus for 2 weeks and in between when I tried to contact the doctor, he was not at all reachable. And that didn't even affect my issue a bit.I think more than boasting about his fake promises, he should understand the issue first and be more human in treating or in his advice.",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore

He appears to take simple approach, and doesn't over prescribe medicines. In my case, I find what is prescribed to me is simple, but not very holistic. In both instances I met, appointment didn't happen in time, I had to wait sometime. 

Important Observation: He is the ONLY doctor I met so far, who ""printed"" prescription instead of writing. Great. The printed prescription contains whether the medicine prescribed is a tablet/capsule / injection, when to take it morning/afternoon/evening, and whether before food or after. Great, Impressive, Unambiguous! I surely remember him for this. Apparently he maintains patient history well. 

Yes, I would recommend this doctor to my family and friends.

"Dr. Shalini Joshi is our family physician for the past five years. She has always coped with us to provide a better experience in healthcare. As I have observed, there may be around 30 to 40 minutes of waiting time. The crowd will be huge anyways and the management is striving for their best service. The only thing I would like to suggest to them is that they should extend the OPD hours in the evening session. So that the patients who might have to travel from long distances after their work can visit the hospital during these hours.",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"I was admitted to Fortis for Dengue treatment a few weeks back. Firstly during my first consultation, she was extremely rude and sarcastic about my condition and when I insisted to talk to my family before getting admitted, she advised me that I should talk to them only about marriage and nothing else! The same day, however, I got admitted because of falling platelet count but unfortunately, didn’t change the doctor.On the same night, my family arrived in the hospital. With a steeply falling platelet count, she was supposed to inform then about the procedure, protocol and need for the platelets transfusion, which include strict criteria for finding the suitable donor. The junior staff who visited me during the night created unnecessary panic and were also afraid of talking and disturbing Dr Shalini. Clearly, she is someone who commands through fear and intimidates her staff, from junior doctors to nurse to the blood bank staff, everyone was afraid of contacting her.Later in the night a chaotic situation followed many rounds of discussions and due to the unavailability of a suitable donor, RDP (random donor platelets) were transfused instead of a better option (SDP single donor platelets) which could have been taken care, if the information was correctly communicated earlier in the day. The hospital staff literally asked us to arrange a donor at 11 PM in the night even though they could have foreseen this earlier. The doctor never bothered to inform my family anything about the time consuming process of arranging a donor, which is more difficult than arranging simple blood donors. The next day, we submitted an application to request the change of doctor, to which she reacted by storming into my room and confronting me and my family without being sensitive of my condition. Her taunting way towards my family was not at all a good sight and clearly she lacked any empathy or compassion towards the patient.Since RDPs are not readily accepted by the body, another SDP transfusion was required the next day after we arranged a healthy donor in the morning. thankfully, by then the hospital superintendent had accepted our request of change of doctor and after a thorough inquiry, provided us a new doctor.Although i had been visiting doctor joshi for the last 3-4 years for my annual health checkup consultation, her true behaviour was only revealed during this critical time. Even in the annual checkup consultation, she used to act very cold and without any empathy towards the patient but i had really not expected her to be so bad!When you visit a big hospital like fortis, you expect comfort and a sense of responsibility for the high price you pay. Unfortunately we were devoid of all this. If you don’t have 100% faith on her, i would definitely recommend you to request for a change of doctor immediately after you are assigned Dr Shalini Joshi because there are much better options available at Fortis. ",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"I am been going to Fortis Hospital for my health check up since 2012. Dr Shalini Joshi was the assigned doctor 3 times. In my experience avoid her and take some other doctor available at that time. You can request at the reception to re-assign to some other doctor.

So with Dr Shalini Joshi, she is always in a hurry. And you cannot ask her any questions. She doesn't like it and it will be apparent on her face. For formality reason she might answer one question half-heartedly. And when it comes to the medical reports, she will highlight with a pen the not-normal reading(which any human can read and understand) and will not explain what they are and what is causing it. I had high levels of uric acid in my report. She said to talk to a dietician about a healthy diet.

And in the reception area she will create a havoc. I have see her shouting at the receptionist for not sending patients on time. She has to leave by 1:00PM and if you are the last patient then you are wasting your time and money.

I highly recommend to not consult with her. If you have any other option please go ahead with that. And if you are in Fortis then you have tons of choice. When going for a health checkup, mention in the reception to not assign Dr Shalini Joshi.",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore

Turns out both are third generation cephalosporins, and it doesn't make sense to prescribe one not tested sensitive in the report.

Doctor him self is writing to re visit after 1 month a d we need to pay the full amount once again. Why don't you change this policy from your side.I want to suggest your management is after the first visit you should give the free consultation once again as per the doctors confirmation.For the same treatment after 1 month I visited and I paid the total consultation fee today. Again doctor asked me to visit after 1 month.So these kind of re visiting charges either it should be waved off OR should keep it as very minimal as we come for the same treatment and this is my sincere request.Hope for the next month I will get good feedback on this.Note: I am not able to upload the proof of prescription and if you need you can check my visit in your records ,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"I'm very thankfull to Dr Shashidhar for his guidelines and making my dream comes true. Before him i consulted one famous Andrologist in Hyderabad and there was no progress in anything. When i shifted to bangalore, i came to know abt shashidar through Practo and visited Manipal hospital. I was facing issues like low sperm count and delayed ejaculation. He was patient to listen my problems and gave medicine for a month and given some suggestions for Retrograde ejaculation and everything started working slowly. In the next visit(after a month), my concern was about low sperm count and he suggested some tablet for the same. I never thought that there will be such drastic change in sperm count within a month as i believed sperm count never going to increase beyond a level with any medicine.

I was suffering from erectile dysfunction and non consummate marriage.  We came to know about Dr shashidhar and approached him with my issue. He conducted only 2 tests penile doppler and testosterone which he said will support the diagnosis. He recommended minor surgical procedure.  We availed insurance. The whole process was taken care well by Dr shashidhar n his team and we had a very nice experience without any stress. After the surgery I am on my path to recovery and am very positive about the outcome. Thanks doctor.,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"I am very thankful to Dr. Shashidar B for his guidance. I consulted him for low sperm count and poor motility. But before consulting him I approached two other andrologists for the same issue and I was said to undergo varicose surgery in order to improve my motility and I had also undergone this surgery, and the result was poor again. Almost 4 years of this try my result was zero. Then I approached Dr. Shashidhar. He is such a dynamic personality who solved my struggle of 4 years in 4 months. He examined my issue suggested me some medications and most wanted thing he filled me with positive thoughts and asked me to be positive always. My count was very low and with this value we are the couples who stand in IVF category. But Dr. Shashidar insisted us to attempt one IUI session even though the value of sperm count was against the guidelines value for IUI. This positive attitude of his made our dreams true. It was a successful IUI and today my wife is 6 weeks pregnant. He is very humble and has lot of patience to listen to our concerns.  Thanks sir for being there with us.",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"Doctor is really good in terms of hearing out the patient, explaining the possible reasons of the ailment & may be explaining the questions asked.
The way he spoke was really very gentle & hypnotizing.

Disappointing factor is... 
just for 3 days of fever & throat infection which was clearly visible, he gave me prescription for 5-6 tablets thrice a day.

Moreover, just for 3 days of fever, he prescribed me all possible tests (Urine, Blood culture, Swab test, Dengue, Malaria & Jaundice) saying, he wanted to eradicate all chances... 

3rd day of fever & these many tests costing Rs. 5000/- ?

I had no other go than spending that much & getting the tests done... needless to say, every test result was negative.
It was a clear case of Throat infection & one prescribed Antibiotic would suffice.

Somehow, other than the way he speaks to the patient, neither I appreciate the tests & loads of medicines nor the hospital which charges 5000/- for which other labs like Thyrocare & many other would charge 1800/-.-2000/-.",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"We met Dr. Nandakumaran after a bad experience at Sakra hospital. My wife Sujata was having frequent high temperature for the 5th day. On day 2 we went to Sakra. It is a big hospital  and near to where we live. The duty doctor's  approach was very casual. She didn't think much of it. She prescribed Dolo-650, which Sujata was already having. We told specifically that the temperature was coming back as the effect of the paracetamol's  effect wears off.  The Doc asked not to worry and continue paracetamol. We were asked to do CBS and the she  said, there was nothing in it. Two days later when Sujata's condition remained the same, we went back and met the same doctor.  She had the same casual attitude and this time send us back with antibiotic. The next day Sujata's condition worsened and she got a blackout. We rushed to meet Dr. Nandakumaran (I found his reference on Practo.com). We choose to go to Dr.Nandakumaran because of his number of years of experience. With Doctor we immediately felt very confident. He examined Sujata and immediately said that he suspected Viral Pneumonia. The chest X-ray confirmed it. He advised us to shift to Narayana. Sujata was in the intensive care unit for 3 days. She finally got discharged yesterday. Doctor went out of the way and visited Sujata at the ICU two times and also inquired on the phone on a daily basis. His reassuring words had very positive effect on Sujata and definitely helped her speedy recovery. We visited Doctor yesterday on out way back to thank him. He patiently read through the reports and advised on good diet etc. We are very thankful to Dr. Nandakumaran.

It might sound a bit orthodox, but I know a lot of people including myself  are very skeptical about the credentials of doctors. Whether they passed on merit or on a payment seat is very important give that and one with money can now buy a seat. I personally avoid doctors with less than 40 Years of age, because if they are above 40, they most likely didn't come through a payment seat. I suspect the doctor we met at Sakra was one such.

I was too late to see the reviews. After 40 mins of waiting, when I was finally blessed to meet him. I was greeted with arrogance and that looking mobile and talking really gets on your nerves. Highly unprofessional and has no respect towards others. He asked the nurse to take me to another doctor and come back to me later which I am glad he did as he met a decent human being when it was done apparently doctor had left somewhere and I was not ready for a waiting game so I left.

Registration and advance booking is a joke here,  receptionists note everything in a register and keep mixing up the appointments. There were 2 patients with the same timing. The doc was friendly and listened patiently to our problems2. Second visit - Appointment issue continue to exist. However, this time, our experience with the doctor was really bad. The only word which comes to my mind is unprofessional, while we were trying to narrate our problems, he was busy scrolling his phone and kept on receiving calls. He also dialled a number and then said, I got a call from this number so let me check. The call was a sales call, and to our surprise he continued speaking to the sales person over call enquiring about some scheme. All this while, we kept our calm and continue when he disconnected the call. Despite the file being in front of him, it seemed as if he had no idea about what was going on and then he narrated some diagnosis which was complete opposite of what he said in first visit. When I reminded him of that, he tried to come up wit an answer but then later said, can’t really say anything right now and told us to consult the physiotherapist. Please avoid him at all costs.

"I had not heard of cupping therapy until my friend who had visited this centre mentioned to me about the therapy and also praised the quality of the centre its hygiene and the following of standards according to UK. After i visited the centre i felt i am in an International clinic with the ambience and that made me feel i would definitely get a cure to my ailment. The people there were very courteous and gave importance to me as an individual and provided me water till i had completely looked around the cleanliness and the way the clinic was maintained and confused if i was in India. I was now eager to know cupping therapy and the way it was done even though i knew a little brief about it. I completed the form which took my complete history and i did not have to wait as my appointment was booked and i met the doctor on time, As i entered the consultation room it was very energetic and peaceful by the way it was maintained and kept clean like the ones Internationally, the doctor was very polite and courteous and listened to me patiently and explained the procedure and therapy she would perform making me feel at ease and reliving me of my ailment almost 50% before the therapy. I was taken into the wards which had everything organised in a unique way completely different to what i had seen n other hospitals. The lady assisting the doctor was very polite and spoke in such a nice way making me feel important and the therapy started wight he doctor explaining to me at every point before and after application of the cups. I felt relived and light and energetic that hallway through i realised i had slept due to the therapy. The effects of the therapy lasted for almost a month and my lower back pain was reduced to almost 50% in the first session. The doctor advised me 4 sessions. It was wonderful knowing this therapy and made complete sense to me and i recommend everybody comes to try it as only if you try will you know the difference and if not atleast to visit the centre for its quality and cleanliness. We need more and more number of clinics like this in India which follows such high standards and gives importance to every patient. Eager to visit again for my 2nd session.

"'Apart from persistent cough with mucus, phlegm, wheezing, breathing problems, I had developed groin swelling which was painful'.Dr. Hemkumar knows the #1 cause of the medical problem from the first time counselling session itself, which shows his vast experience across various medical fields. He prescribes medicines and any scans (if required) that are actually exactly directed to the medical problem. I have been hospitalized as was required due to 26000+ wbc count found through cbc test. As well, groin infection required specialized treatment so he very rightly referred my case to Urology department where I was rightly treated. I recovered in just 3days. Dr. Hemkumar knows where should a patient be referred. Dr. Hemkumar frequently met me in ward throughout the entire time period from when I was hospitalized up until I was discharged. He is very friendly, gives good personal touch advices, and overall nice human being very compassionate and empathetic. He even adviced me on the claim process of company based insurance. As Dr. Hemkumar ensures that only required specialized treatment is referred, exact medicines are prescribed, etc. so final bill is also very less than expected. In a nutshell, very respected doctor among his fraternity and always keeps things very simple and happy/jolly for the patient.

She brings alive the forgotten concept of family doctor by being totally invested in our well-being and doesn’t treat us like tokens/ one time transactions. 3.

The only issue I had was with wait time. Clinic has a weird rule where followup patients dont have to take appointments. Which means they will be sent in between patients with appointments,which is a prob. I had appointment at 945am, but i was allowed to see doctor only at around 1040am as there were 3 followup patients. So theres really no value for taking appointments. Oh n mind you i have viral fever with secondary bacterial infection sitting n waiting while having fever over 100 F with severe internal chills. ",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"            Dr Taher is very special. The way which he diagnose patients is totally different with respect to other doctors. The basic and main element observed from him is the patience. He listens to every patient with patience and understands the concern from the scratch and then take an action in the form of careful observation treatment. He is simply superb.          Also the treatment will be like a step by step ie how we climb the ladder one by one. He makes patients more comfortable by explaining in detail and working most of the times at the root cause. He is a kind of person who actually emphasis on root cause rather than work around and that is the ultimate specialty of him.            Most of the times he doesn't rush but sometimes due to important and emergency cases along with more number of patients waiting, he seems to be rush. In total he is one of the ultimate gentlemen of all the doctors available near BTM area. I always suggest his name where ever it's possible so that I could have done justice to the humanity.

Explained about my condition in great detail and suggested me to go for a traditional treatment technique in place of costly scans or x-rays or blood tests or meds. He also provided lots of tips on how to cure using naturally available food instead of adding more antibiotics etc.. Even if it takes couple of extra days for the cure, its always better if your body fights it out right away while relying less on meds..The review won't be complete without the mention of the clinical staff who provided a warm welcome and great hospitality throughout. My humble thanks to each one of them. Special mention about one of the staff named Mr. Rajashekhar who event had a pleasant conversation with me to make sure I don't feel bored or feel left out during a hot steam dip treatment.

He did one blood test at Vibrant Life clinic itself and thought of it as infection in the stomach.He prescribed some medicines(Norflox and Pantop) for 5 days and advised to have ultrasound scan of abdomen and urine culture and asked us to visit after we get the reports. After taking the medicines for 4 days the pain was reduced and we visited the doctor after we got the reports. After examining the report Dr Narendra thought of it as Gastric pain and prescribed some medicines( Pantop-D and related to Vitamins as the vitamin level was also very low). he advised us to wait for 10 days and if the pain continues even after 10 days of medicines then we will do endoscopy. So I can't comment much on the treatment satisfaction for now as we are still undergoing treatment.Bot overall Dr Narendra seems ** ** * ************* ****** *** ********** **** ********* *** focus on treatment with change in lifestyle of an individual.

Doctor along with the hospital nurse Aruna lifted me up, put me up on the table and provided  emergency care treatment (Intra venuous saline and injection) to revive my pressure and bring me back to normal. While this is not something unexpected or unusual of a doctor or a clinic, the speed at which these 2 took care of it was amazing. One of the important observations is that they do a great job at ensuring the required care is passed on to the passengers in a timely manner without a hidden eye towards minting money.

I asked her to update my account with medical records after the diagnosis, she denied to do that. I know I've used practo before and I'm aware how much useful it can be, but if the hospital is not ready to cooperate then its of no use.I request Practo to please reach out to them and check if they're still compliant with you guys.

I said ok. Finally without giving tratment for first suggested gastric problem he is asking to take ecg in his hospital. then I told him first give treatment for gastric as you told after 2 hours if it is not reduced we can go for secondry fir that he got angry he he took prescription and wrote husband is not willing to take ecg and he is showing all his anger on throwing pen harshly and closing cupboard harshly.

"I took my mother for a checkup after she was complaining of dizziness. The patiently heard her case history, and took her stethoscope and after returning to the table wrote my mother's bp as 140/90 mm hg. I was surprised as i didnt see the cuff was ever uses or Sphygmomanometer. When i inquired, she retorted and claimed she did the measurement. My mother also said that the measurement was not done. This infuriated her and and she said who is the doctor, you or me. My mom undergoes regular sugar and other checkups, though she never had a history, and it is a well known fact, which could be confirmed from studies that Indian sub-population has vitamin d deficiency when looked with internal reference limits. However,  I dont see enough literature suggesting a study that states that indian population reference levels have been relooked. However, studies have repeatedly confirmed an endemic problem with vitamin d deficiency. I didnt find anything truly illuminating from what she said. However, i was surprised when she claimed that she measured the bp without the Sphygmomanometer. What i doubt is perhaps the doctor may have forgotten inadvertently, and I would have given her the benefit of the doubt. However, she retorted stating that she measured. When i got the doubt was not the untouched cuff, but the numbers she had written, as mother normally may be once in 20 readings has her pressure in that range.",I do not recommend the doctor,Bangalore

"One sentence -> She is a brilliant general physician.

I along with my family have gone to her for various illness and all the times we have been cured well. I have observed the medicines prescribed by her have a perfect balance between targeting for quick relief as well as solving the root cause as much as possible.

As an example, when I had kidney stones, she not only gave medicines for curing it but also suggested some (including Ayurvedic) for long term cure as once a body has stones, it is prone to repeat. On day 1, even before scanning, she had suspected the cause of pain and had also given medicine on side effects of stones which prevented  further damage.

Over the years we have experienced how she has helped through many deceases such as thyroid, blood pressure, calcium, D3 etc deficiency, viral fevers etc of people in my family.

On a side note, I would like to highlight one thing here, which actually is a positive, that I have seen she tries to avoid use of antibiotic or stronger doses unless absolutely necessary.

But as the time passed and the problem aggravated, I was extremely anxious to find out. In a first consultation with a general physician, he told me it could range from bronchitis to allergies. With bouts of breathlessness almost every day, I consulted Dr. Huzefa using the Practo app. He patiently listened to my symptoms, and performed tests using a Spirometer. He checked my chest for congestion. And after some further inquiries he told me that I may suffer from Allergies. I was upset, as Allergies is a condition that has no cure. But he reassured me that with the right medication, it would not affect my lifestyle. He prescribed few medicines. His tone really inspired confidence.I am currently undertaking the course of medication.

"I consulted Dr Sabina Rao for my mother's anxiety and depressive disorder that had wreaked havoc on her life for over one year. We had already been through two of Bangalore most renowned psychiatrists but had not seen any positive developments. By the time we visited Dr Rao, we were therefore mostly without hope. But the very first meeting went off amazingly well, and her way of speaking and assuring us made my mother feel a lot better and confident. She also tweaked the medicine dosage that did wonders for the anxiety and depression. Since then, we've been consulting Dr Rao. She is attentive and genuinely concerned about her patients and pays minute attention to everything that's being spoken as well as looks out for tacit signals in the patients demeanor and body language.I would strongly recommend her as a compassionate and effective doctor.",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"Dr Rao appears competent in her field and we visited to get a treatment plan and diagnosis for my child. However, as a mother I was surprised that Dr Rao asked a number of intrusive, personal and completely irrelevant questions on my ability to support myself and my child.  Repeated attempts to redirect her to the case at hand failed, and we wasted a lot of appointment time on a discussion of my career and her apparent lack of belief that I could financially fend for myself and my child.  I finally had to literally tell her that we were ok and that I had full confidence in my career abilities.It is disappointing to see a woman professional show such sexism towards other women. It hurts women and female children. I am sure no man would have been subject to such intrusive questions.  As a senior executive myself and one who works with both women and men, I would hope Dr Rao would moderate her style. We intend to continue with her because I feel she is a competent medical professional.",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
"This was my first visit. I came in defensive, I thought I wouldn't share or talk about much; I planned on keeping it civil and I didn't expect to like her....after all....and after all I have been through these last few years.... I don't trust anyone and..I was told that in the practice of Psychiatry in India today.. It's tough to find a doctor who really cares about you ..... It's all about the rupee.. ******** *** ********* ** *** ******** ** *** *** ******** Confident, warm, friendly but not overbearing or patronizing... She maintained firm eye contact and appeared genuine. She is sharp, well-traveled, eloquent and non-judgmental. I opened up to her almost immediately.  I left feeling very very grateful that I had been referred and pushed to make that appointment to see her - I have been putting it off for almost 2 months. Finally making the appointment to meet Dr Rao, was one of the best decisions I've made in the last,  couple of terrible months of my life. ",I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
Gone to see the doctor to get some tips to better manage my trouble making son. She advised us to set the family hierarchy in order and make the child understand where his place in the family is. Giving kids too much importance can cause kids to act out .Very valuable advice.,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
The pills prescribed by the Dr were very helpful in dealing with my panic attacks which ruined my sleep schedule. She helped me make sure I would get the full sleep needed to face the day.,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
She is someone who listens very carefully and takes time to understand the situation as well as proceeding with the solution. She didn't jump to conclusion and was not inclined to give medication when the problem can be solved using therapy. My therapy is still in progress and I am so glad already feeling happier than before I met her. I wish all the therapists out there could be like her. ,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore
Dr. Sabina Rao is a very good doctor. Initially I was hesitant as I took an appointment online just based on online reviews. When I met her for the first time I was already feeling much lighter.

She's a very patient listener and just by meeting her you tend to feel positive about yourself. ,I recommend the doctor,Bangalore

The only embarrassing thing was to put my pants down and show the penis in front of a lady attendant, who was a compounder probably. Although the doc told me to lie down in a bed covered with a screen, but the lady came in between and my down part was completely nacked that time (the doc was examining that time with pooling my forskin back). But as both of them were muslims, I think they handled it very smartly, and the lady stayed there for the rest of time and helped me to get comfortable with. After examining, doc advised me not to get circumcised as my foreskin retracts back easily and he told it's not a condition of phimosis.

He prescribed blood tests (to be done in his lab immediately), a chest x-ray at a nearby nursing home and hospital admission (incase condition worries overnight, where he specified two nursing home nearby where he consults).While we didn't 'feel' right about his advise, but it was his insistence that we get things at at his clinic/lab that really had us peeved. I told him that we do not wish to take nebulization now and would like to get the tests done outside. He did not take it well and and asked me if I was going to decide why have I come to him?

"Dr Guru Prasad Udupi is hands-down one of the best medical doctors i have seen in my 40 years of life! Took my mom and uncle for a consult. I find that doctors usually are distracted or rushed when seeing their patients, but not with Dr Guru. It gave me the sense that this doctor REALLY cared about his patients whole being and not just the fact that they needed a consult. His demeanour, mannerism, positive yet practical advise, and attentive nature is exceptional.Additionally, i could tell that doctor has a well-rounded medical knowledge. I have usually heard doctors attribute all/any  complaints of a patient to diabetes but for the first time I could see how his logical questioning and tests was leading to something the patient was unaware of in the past. His diagnosis and investigation is impeccable. He is very clear with his explanation and treatment plan. Gets down to the level of a common man to explain. He even pointed out how a banned drug was prescribed, changed  medication also adjusted the medication appropriately. He is an EXTRAORDINARY DOCTOR and an EXTRAORDINARY and HUMBLE HUMAN BEING. I would definitely recommend Dr Guruprasad Udupi and his practice Dialife Diabetes Thyroid & Endocrine Centre Vidyaranyapuram Bangalore to anyone who values their health and wants a doctor that’s holistic, empowering and truly cares.

"We visited the Center to consult with a cardiologist and the GP - Dr. Nagraj.

The cardiologist recommended some tests at a diagnostic lab that he has tie ups with and that experience was pathetic. They didn't have the equipment, the attitude of the staff was lackadaisical and the overall experience was far from desirable. He was interested only in scheduling one more test the next day even when it was apparent for anyone to see that the patient needed urgent medication and care. The Dr. Seemed inexperienced and out of his element.

Coming to Dr. Nagraj himself. Was over an hour late for the appointment. Did not prescribe any medication for the infection. Ordered more tests and prescribed a change in bp medication, which the gastrointestinal and cardio specialists at Fortis told us the next day were absolute garbage and could have actually risked the patients life!

"Hi All, Before starting my review, i would like to thank realself and all the reviews that have encouraged me to do the Hair Transplant. I have been losing my hair slowly from 20 years old. I did try minoxidil which did work for me, gain back most of my hair, but after 3 years of using the effect has slowly disappeared. I guess the DHT hormone must have gotten too strong. One day, i gave up with the minodixil, i was thinking there is no way i would use this for my whole life and it didn't really have any effect on me anymore. I am losing more hair after quitting as expected, from grade 4 to grade 6 in around 6 months time. For those who does not know, minoxidil only retain your hair if you keep using it, the hair will fall out once you stop using it, as you will be in your ""real"" hair loss stage. I had been thinking of getting a hair transplant and got it done the result were good. After searching on google, i found this website and i read the review. I found out that in Bangalore. After going through the reviews for months, i decided i would go through the HT procedure with Dr. Vikas SIngh, the results from that clinic are great!
