So much so that he didn't even ask the patients name. Maybe we disturbed his sleep schedule. Also, even though it says the clinic opens at 5 in the evening, it doesn't.

"There are no adequate words to express my heartfelt appreciation for Dr. Sanchayan Roy. He brought back my mother from a near-vegetative state to her usual buoyant self. During a span of three years, my 80-year-old mother fractured both sides of her hip; had an infected gallbladder that had to be removed; was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs; suffered from dementia, and silently slid into deep depression. She stopped talking and eating, became immobilized and was unable to control her bodily fluids. Dr. Roy steered back her cognitive skills and with his team rebuilt her broken physical strength. Today she is walking, attending philosophy classes and taking an active interest in life. Dr. Sanchayan Roy returned my mother back to us!Additionally, Dr. Roy is an excellent geriatric care doctor who combines short-term health problems with long-term continuum of care. He coordinated my mother‚Äôs myriad medications for multiple age-related ailments to create a comprehensive health picture. Based on this he generated a preventive care regime that he enforces by reminding family members to act on it. His continuous care gives us hope that we might be able to mitigate some of my mother‚Äôs anticipated health issues by replacing it with a better quality of life. Dr. Roy truly takes his Hippocratic oath seriously (a rare quality these days).Having experienced healthcare in many parts of the world, I can say without hesitation that our experience with Dr. Roy ranks among the best, and I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending him to my friends and to their aging parents. I can cite my experience with Dr. Sanchayan Roy and his team of doctor‚Äôs as a blessing!",I recommend the doctor,Delhi

Many a time I have had to take quick action when she has suddenly collapsed or fallen without warning. My first response is to call Dr. Sanchayan Roy even before informing her family members. He has always picked up the phone and guided me as to what I need to do to stabilize her.

He seem to be very rude in behavior, slowly we became scared of sharing problems with him.

"My overall experience with Doctor Rachna is absolutely outstanding.

I was referred to  Doctor Rachna through a friend for my mother.  Doctor  was extremely forthcoming and happily did a home visit even on Holi .  It was a fantastic first time experience.  She put me at ease right away, explained everything in a calm and understandable manner.  She was firm and clear on her instructions and prescriptions. When she realised my mother was over medicated, she immediately took a call and cut it down to bare minimum.  She then referred her to a specialist .  Irrespective of her travels she would respond to my calls, patiently hear and even provide me advise on next steps.

To quote my brother  Doctor Rachna is a ""gem"" in the medical profession.  

I am extremely lucky to be associated with her and would like to recommend her widely.

"Dr. Wali needs no introduction. However, if I am to state something, then I would call him a ‚Äòhealer‚Äô. He doesn‚Äôt simply treat but heals. His diagnosis and memory need no validation but what sets him apart and makes him unique is his humility and assiduous patience. The word ‚Äòmohsin‚Äô is an Arabic word meaning ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô. He epitomises and personifies that . May God give him a happy and healthy life. The planet needs more like him.",I recommend the doctor,Delhi
"He is someone who is blessed with a desire to serve and care for the people. This makes him one of the most unique doctors who have such an amazing healing effect on the patients who visit him that half of the battle is won in the first meeting itself.My first experience with him was almost 3 years ago when he was serving in the President' Estate and my father was suffering from acute hypertension and it was getting very difficult for us to even walk him into a hospital. Admitting him seemed the logical choice at that moment and luckily for us we were introduced to him through our family member. Somehow, we managed to take him there after his assurances, though I was apologetic to not meet the appointment time due to the challenge. But his phone call assuring me that everything will be well-just lead my father to him hospital inspired me and made me believe that he is the man!His insistence of keeping my father on mild doses, not going into a psychiatric hospital , not to admit him and he recovering after 7 days- all of them proved right and I can also saw that he has a knack of ability to anticipate the patient's future- Some may call it miracle, I call him a blend of science and his logical intuitiveness. Thanks, to him- my father is doing pretty well and out of that problem.Yesterday, I visited him after my sugar levels went up for the first time in my life and that too a high level(`280). I visited a very famous and experienced doctor in Noida one week before who straight away asked me to be put on insulin without even understanding my lifestyle. This intrigued me and therefore I decided to walk up to sir Mohsin' clinic. He created a good solid 6 month plan for me and assured me to be off the medications in a short window and when I went back home I really saw a 60 points drop in my glucose levels.I am lucky to live in an era where doctors like him are there!!"" Truly at your service"" is the motto which he believes and every doctor should do the same.The only feedback which i think can be done better is the queue management. People jump out of the queue and straightaway many people walk into his room. Which doesn't feel good for the people who sit patiently waiting for their turn. Though, Zaffar does a good job monitoring it but the inflow of patients is more and staff cant monitor it all. Webcam system monitored by doctor yourself can work better or allocating this to someone who really implements a queue system may be the need of the hour.",I recommend the doctor,Delhi
"'He prayeth best, who loveth best/All beings both great and small...' - Samuel Taylor Coleridge.                     Dr Mohsin Wali.                 I first met him in Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi. He had been there to check on the health of the then First Lady of India, Suvra Mukherjee. I requested him (with a little hesitation obviously) to see my blood pressure. Most delightfully he not only checked my BP also advised me on health issues. And there was an immediate connect, which till this day exists. A series of Presidents-- R Venkataraman, Dr S D Sharma, Pranab Mukherjee, Mrs Fakruddin Ali Ahmed, Mrs Zakir Hussain, Prime Minister V P Singh... Doctor's pantheon of patients is indeed prodigious. Still he remains a man who is firmly rooted to the ground and answers every knock on the door, not from any prospect of gain, but from love for all. He doesn't believe in any kind of discrimination. Thank you Doctor. Pray you retain your health and heart. And we will keep calling you in hour of need. Sangeeta Ghosh. Author and Journalist.",I recommend the doctor,Delhi

"I consider myself fortunate to find him at the right time.  I visited him in my most unexplainable mental trauma condition which I was unable to express in words when I learnt about the diagnoses done for my heart condition but after meeting him, it was like I was immediately put on peace. The way he receives you, the way he talk to you, the way he empathize and the way he give you confidence that you will be fine, can not be explained appropriately.  I would wish each and every living person a very healthy life but just in case if one feels any challenges about their health situation, should visit/must visit Dr Wali for his expertise and kind advises where no false promises are made.  He is capable of judging your health situation by looking at you and you will get to know after meeting him that you are not taken for granted and you are not getting misguided for any false diagnose and you will get correct treatment and medicines.

Thank you",I recommend the doctor,Delhi
Very experienced doctor. He just provides the right and limited number of medicines. No unnecessary tests.Recommended!,I recommend the doctor,Delhi
"I consulted Dr. Anuj Gupta after a shock when another doctor diagnosed me with Asthma on having a cough for just 2 days!! Dr. Anuj Gupta's reaction to my dose (the 1 dose which I had taken the previous night) was ""so, you are already on steroids""!!
He asked about my problem in detail, spent a lot of time listening to me, didn't exaggerate the diagnosis (As it turns out, I have Bronchial Allergy and NOT Asthma) and prescribed me the very basic medicines (no steroids). And I am already feeling better, both physically and mentally.
He was very very friendly and cordial.
Two anecdotes which I'd like to share-
1. When I asked him about the precautions to be taken, he said, ""Go to Europe!! Or in the Coastal regions!""
He meant that pollution levels are so high in Delhi, so go enjoy your life somewhere else. I mean how often do you find such a cool doctor with an awesome precaution. 
2. Somebody called him and maybe insisted on getting some medicines prescribed. Dr. Gupta then said, ""Relax, no medicine is the best medicine."" Coming form a doctor, this WAS important.
So, bottom line is, he is the best Pulmonologist in Delhi, and if you see visit him, be assured of a good treatment and a nice experience.",I recommend the doctor,Delhi
"His diagnosis was accurate. My medical condition of 3 months was cured in matter of 10 days. Dr. Anuj 's attitude is very friendly and hospitable. He is definetly a great find through Practo. No wonder most patients recommend his consultancy.
My best regards for Dr Anuj. Thank you for your advice and diagnosis. :)
Am breathing just fine now.",I do not recommend the doctor,Delhi

I visited Dr. 3 times however even after performing all the tests prescribed by Dr., he could not investigate the cause of pain. Dr. gave me vitamin D medicine and pain killer medicine. However even after two weeks of taking medicine, my pain was far from over. Then I went to a Physiotherapist. He was able to help me properly. The pain was in the tendons connecting heel and the arch of feet. Physiotherapist did not gave me any medicine and the pain in my heel was over in a week's time. There could be various reasons for the heel pain. However a doctor should be able to tell you the cause of the pain and work for that cause and not give pain killer. In my opinion, taking pain killer medicine wherever avoidable is a bad idea. ",I recommend the doctor,Delhi

Being a senior citizen he got up from his chair to bid me good bye and wish me well.

"I went to visit Dr Aman Vij as part of routine check along with my parents with our health reports for Cholesterol levels, Sugar, Liver profile, Thyroid, vitamin B12, D, Iron level & few others test stats. I appreciate that Dr Aman is very Intelligent & has got a  quick grasp capturing all the stats & is able to comprehend, suggests medicines only if needed , otherwise whenever it can be treated with some diet restrictions & change in eating habits, Dr Aman normally takes that route. My Cholesterol level was 278-280 last year in April 2018 & I was taking medicines for it some related to Cholesterol & other related to liver but things were not working. I remained in this level of Cholesterol till I met Dr Aman who asked to changes in food habit, oils & asked me to stop any medicine I was taking. Now when I got my cholesterol tested it came out 237 without any medicine, to be honest I was on diet restriction but not completely I ordered from Zomato & swiggy on weekend only. So I am happy & satisfied with my treatment so far. This time I also convinced my Parents & we went all together to get the consultation for them. Just to give little background, my Parents have also some alignments like Cholesterol (Both), Sugar (Papa) & Thyroid (Mom), Liver (Mom),body pain(Mom), swelling on body & on they are on medication. My Parents live outside Delhi & not much fluent in understanding English like me but definitely both of them are good in it. They have in past taken many consultant from other Doctors & know there body well. They had hard time in understanding Dr. Advice as he was speaking everything in just English. Dr. Aman was very intelligently able to understand that My mom don‚Äôt have Sugar & had current report was showing marginally high level & prescribed her medicine for 3 months only. But both of them were complaining about Doctor taking the blood pressure for his own sake & not writing them or explaining to them what the intensity. Also there were some medicine which were already prescribed to Papa earlier which were not suiting him. When Dr Aman Vij prescribed them again, we told him they don‚Äôt suit, he said currently they have to take them only.  So it was kind of mixed reaction, while I was happy ,but my Parents wanted things to be explained more to them patiently in language they can understand .Also they wanted that Doctor should hear them & suggest alternatives if any for any medicine which is not suiting to them as they were from outside Delhi & were skeptical about starting new medicine which if don't work well would be able to return to Delhi before 5-6 months.  They belong to small town where they is dearth of medical facilities & good doctors.",I recommend the doctor,Delhi

Although the symptoms were not there for that particular issue and I asked if I can it re run and got it done immediately from hospital itself and by god grace report was normal. He was prompt and honest, however, I believe he could have asked for the rest to be rerun himself as my mother did not have any symptoms accordingly to the report as had I admitted her and run the treatment it would have been an unnecessary expense and running around.

Dr. Abhinav did explain me everything from which medicines to take, what physiotherapy I should go for to some face exercises in great detail. Also, as I was foing follow ups with him each month during that time, he always gave me the assurance and comfort that I needed as all of a sudden waking up with a 'frozen' face was definitely not a good feeling. Overall, it took me good 3 months to recover completely and I give full credit to Dr. Abhinav for my recovery. Ever indebted. I highly recommend him as a trusted medical practitioner.

"We had to wait for an hour to see the doctor. And when we went to see him there were 4-5 other people also there, door was open and people kept going out and coming in. It was very odd as there was no privacy. I had to talk about my miscarriages and my health issues like I am giving a speech to someone and anyone is free to listen to what I have to say. This was not at all expected. As a patient and as a person who is quite sensitive about discussing these heartfelt problems of not able to conceive, I felt very uncomfortable. But I still told about my history and details asked. We were hardly there for 10- 15 mins. Most of the time was taken by the doctor to provide notes to his assistants about my case. I mean I was repeatedly asked about how many miscarriages I had. They were confused whether I had 3 or 4!! This was very insensitive of the team. I tried to ask all the questions I had in mind but it still felt that I should hurry. After paying a consultation fees of 2000‚Çπ, I was made to feel that meeting the doctor is a previlage, and somehow those people are doing a favour to me.In summary it was all very rushed and not all all confortable. I kept fighting tears while talking about my history and doctor or his team didn't do much to make me feel at ease.

Although he didn't explain,  too much science behind why a particular medicine was being prescribed.  He handled me & my family really well at the same time. He always diagnosed the right problem & prescribe accordingly. 

He explained to me about my course of treatment very patiently. He told me very very minute details as well,eg., how to handle insulin, how we can vary the dosage according to the diet, changing the needle & etc. He was not in a hurry to look other patients. 

I am very much satisfied with the consultation & treatment. I would definitely recommend Dr. Pritam Gupta to my friends & family.

"Never ever go to this man when in trouble. We called him Home to see my father (age 58) as he has excess dehydration. He gave him 4-5 injections and asked us not to give him any food/ liquid for 2-3 hours. After he left, my father suddenly called us in his room and said something is happening to me, give me water. He started closing his eyes again and again after that. We called the doctor again and when he checked, my dad‚Äôs blood pressure was so low that it was immeasurable by the equipment.. This man told us to take him to the hospital, we gave my dad some ORSo on advice of some other doctor we contacted through phone. As soon as my dad got up to go to the hospital, he fell on the floor. On the way to the hospital, when we were keeping my dad awake with a sip or two of ORS, this doctor urged to get down at his home before we went to the hospital, right when we didn‚Äôt know if he will make it to the hospital. But this guy, leaving my dad and us in this condition, got down at his home and never even called back to enquire if my dad lived or not. Thankfully, by god‚Äôs grace, we made it to the hospital in time and my dad was fine in 4-5 days. In short, don‚Äôt go to this doctor even if that‚Äôs the last resort you have!",I do not recommend the doctor,Delhi

After I got those medicine he confirmed from me if I have bought from the shop he asked for. He gave me injection on my arm. Post that I suffered from heavy fever, so next day I  again came to his clinic. He increased the number of medicine and gave another injection on my hip. Now my legs started paining really hard with no change in fever. Next day again I went to his clinic and he increased the number of medicine. ****** ***** ********* *** *** *********** **** I was unable to lift my hand even forget about getting down of my bed. I thought of consulting another doctor and asked my father to collect my case/medicine history from him ( by default he do not give it to patient and, he give medicine from clinic as well), now he denied providing the same to my father. With all the strength left in me, I visited another doctor with all medicine bills i had purchased to showcase my case history. New doctor gave me a corocin within clinic, asked me not to take any of the medicine which dr Naresh had prescribed and asked me to eat homemade dal khichdi and corocin only if I feel fever. Very next day I was fit enough to rejoin my office. And by the way he charged a minimum of 850 from me for each consultation and not 100 as shown above.",I do not recommend the doctor,Delhi
