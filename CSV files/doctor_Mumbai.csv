Which was at critical levels (this happened because of him completely going off allopathic medicines and relying completely on ayurvedic medicines)He's a type 2 chronic diabetic (having it for over 15 yrs) and he has never been on insulin but here there was no other option but to take up insulin.It was our first time knowing and understanding about insulin. And her to the point consultation and her encouragement to take up insulin without anyone's help really boosted my father's confidence (mine too). Lastly I would have given 5 stars (if there had been star system on practo) because she did not deviate from topic (she didn't go on a ranting spree on how Ayurveda is not so good)She stuck to what was important and she gave a good 40mins to us.",I recommend the doctor,Mumbai

I have been searching for a good doctor for couple of years for my father and i came across Dr. Ajit Shetty and he is Excellent & genuine doctor I have met. He knows his subject very well.Thank Doctor,I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"This review is for  Dr. Ajit Shetty and the Suvidha Hospital staff. A very bad and disheartening experience here.My grandmother was admitted here and we lost her just one day after her discharge.My grandmother was suffering from breathlessness and her stomach was bloated since few days that alerted us to have her check up.Dr.Mamtha Shriyan had suggested to take my grandmother to Dr.Ajit Shetty who was in SRV Hospital then.Dr.Ajit Shetty who had checked her had suggested that we do her chest X Ray ,Sonography and blood test at  Hemant Shah X Ray and Sonography Centre.On 13th Feb 2019 at Hemant Shah X Ray and Sonography Centre,Dr.Hemant did her sonography and immediately called Dr.Ajit Shetty talking about her problem and said that he is sending her at Suvidha Hospital ""NOW"".After keeping the phone he told us to take her there immediately. He didn't even make us sit and talk about her problem *** *** ******** * *** ** ***** saying her kidney has failed.I was taken aback and asked him again ,then he asked for her blood reports which showed s.creatinine 2.9 that was above the permissible limit and said this high level shows her both kidneys have failed. He kept saying the same thing and pushing us to admit her there now .Even after saying that she didn't have her breakfast because of the sonography process he said ""leave it ,she can have it there"". We were already concerned about her health *** **** *** **** ** ** **** *** ****** ** ******** ******** *** ** ***** ** *** *** ******** ** ******* ******** **** ""he himself kept and arranged all the documents I had given him in my folder"" and asked his staff to arrange wheel chair to take my grandmother till the building lift.* *** **** *** **** ** *** ******** ***** ***** **** *** *** ** *********** **** ** ******* **** *** **** ** ***** **** ***** * **** ** ******* **** ** ********** **** ** **** ************* **** *** **** ** *** ******* *** ** ****** *** ***** **** ***** ** *** **** ** **** *** ********* *** ******* *** ****** **** ** ** ** ***** *** ** *** ***** ** ** **** ** **** **** ** ***** *** **** *** ** *** *********** ******** *** ***** ** **** ** ******* ******Here at Suvidha , Dr.Ajit Shetty had intially said her kidney is not functioning properly  and after two days observation she was kept on infusamin injection for three days.During this injection,on the first day she was not to be given food and water ,in the second day we were asked to apply water on her lips to avoid dryness and on the third she was allowed to have liquids. After this course a kidney specialist Dr.Keyur Dave had come to check on her and he cleary said the problem is not her kidneys but its her intestines.Just after the course her stomach had again started bloating!!!This people had checked her sonography *** **** **** ***** ********Few days later Dr.Pradeep Shriyan came who again said her gall bladder movement is not heard and again asked her to be kept on only clear water diet(water and coconut water only).Again the next day ,Dr Shetty asked us again to start giving her liquid diet. ** *** ********* **** **** **** ***** ******** ** ***  *** ****** **** ** ******* ******* ****** ************** ****** ********* **** **** ******** *** *** **** **** **** *** ** ******** ****** **** **** ****** *** **** *** ** ***** She was there for 12 days .They gave us hopes  and almost after 6-7 days  finally gave up when she didn't get better giving reasons such as ""She is old..it's difficult..it's her diet"".******** ** ** ******** *** ********* ******** ****** *** **********she was unable to walk and had become extremely weak.On 9th day(21st Feb 2019) ,she was extremely sleepy all the time and would not wake up even with loudest sound.As much as I have seen her,she doesn't sleep like this with her mouth open and tongue out!!! She would wake up even with the slightest sound.She didn't even urinate because she was so sleepy.I had alerted the nurses and assistant doctors present who said ""she didn't sleep much ..let her sleep"". I dont have problem with her sleeping *** ***** * *** ****** * *** *** **** *** * ****** ***** *** **** ********* I kept highlighting it to the them again saying she didn't urinate since 12 pm after which they checked her and around 11 pm gave her few medicines and glycerin enema and kept her on drips.Since afternoon,it took them 11 hours to take this action.Around 12am she had stool motion with urine and she seemed normal .The next day ,when Dr.Ajit came for doing routine checkup,none of the nurses highlighted it ,I had to tell him after which they prompted it ""yes she was drowsy and she got normal after motion"".The doctor didn't react much. I didn't expect such reaction from a known doctor like him neither did i expect the nurses to describe it so normally. **** ****** **** ******* **** ****** **** ********* ***** ** *** ********* ************ ****** **** **** *************** I even informed them she had started having Nepro Low protein since that day but they ignored saying that could not be the reason.This  sleepiness continued for the next two days,she would just stare and speak less.She wouldn't feel hungry. On 23rd feb 2019, when Dr.Ajit visited her i told him ""her condition has become worse"" and he ignored it saying it's due to her diet and old age and gave her discharge saying nothing more can done keeping her here in hospital. Every nurse that came on that day to give her medicines/injections ignored the fact that my grandmother is not normal and every time I told them she doesn't look normal they would say its her age and liquid diet.My grandmother who herself told us when she wanted to use the washroom couldn't control her bladder and urinated there itself unaware about it.Finally we had to raise our voice to make them realise her situation after which all nurses came and checked her BP which had dropped drastically * ****** **** *** ******* *** ****** ************ ***** *** *** then she was immediately moved to ICU .**** * ******** ** ********* *** ************* ********* ** ** ************** *** *** **** ****** ****** ** **** ******** ******** *** ******* ******** ** ***** ******** ** Also she had wound in her hand for which we had to continuously remind the nurses to check and dress it *** **** ***** ** **** ***** ******** ***** ** ****** ***** This happened because that was not part of the treatment and medicines they are required to give the patient and neither could they see the blood stained bandage in her hand.These only happened because the nurses didn't find it important to give that ""extra attention and care"" as they are not bring paid for that.That means they need a person to be with the patient ,monitor the patient and inform the doctors about them. Why am I paying this huge amount for her treatment in a ""private hospital"" if I am required to do the monitoring .Even in ICU we had to tell them to check if she is urinating,my grandmother was kept in diaper which she was not used to .If she feels like urinating/passing stool she prefers to go to washroom so it was very difficult to convince her to use the diaper instead as she couldn't walk due to her weakness. We had informed the nurse and assistant doctor there about this and asked them to check this.Let me inform you ,she was admitted there for her kidney malfunctioning ,*** **** *** ***** **** ** ***** *** ** *** *** ********* *** ** *** ** **** **** After continuously reminding them ,they went for Urinary catheterization late at night. Similarly next day in morning,she had problem with her stool motion(she also had intestinal malfunctioning) and  we had to remind them to help her either by giving enema or by taking her to the washroom. They didn't take her till the Dr.Ajit came ""around 11 am"" and asked them to take her to washroom.Isn't it wrong  when the medical staff present couldn't understand how critical it was to help the patient to pass stool and urine in time with respect to their health problem only waiting for the doctor's orders!!!!She didn't improve much in ICU ..no one would considering the way they treated her and was asked to be discharged saying nothing much can be done.One who walked inside the hospital had to move out with the help of wheelchair in an extremely pitiable condition.Even on that day I complained to Dr.Ajit regarding the carelessness of the nurses present that lead to her ICU admission and his reply came as a shock to me ""Now you will be looking for faults but instead you need to decide what is to be done with your grandmother..do you want to keep her admitted here or do you want to get her discharged..""and continued telling us about her condition thus diverting our mind **** ***** ****** ** *** **** ******** *** ******* *I expected him to take into consideration our problems but instead he made us feel guilty by thinking ""how can I think of something other than my grandmother.. I am so wrong"". **** ****************And one day after on 26th Feb 2019 she expired!!!!We thought admitting her here under Dr.Ajit Shetty would improve her condition *** ***** ******* *** **** ***** ** *** ******We were charged a hefty fees including the ICU charges where she was admitted **** ******* ** ***** ************ *** the result is disheartening****** **** *** **** ****  ********* *** **** ***** *****  ***** **** ****  ******* **** ******** ********** ***** **** **** ***** *** ** *** ******** ********* ******* ******** ** *** **** ******** ******* ****** ******* **** *** ******** *** ***** ******** ******* ** ********* ** ******* *** ********* ****** ******* *** ***** ** ****** ************  *** **** ** **** * ***** *** *** ******** ********** ** ****** ****************** ********* ** * **** ** ******** ************ **** *** ***** **** *** ************ *********** ** ***** ** ******* **** ** *** * ************* ***** ***** ************ *** ********* *** ** *** ****** ****** **** ** *** ************ *** ** **** *** ******** ****Consult your doctor if you observe any of the following side-effects, especially if they do not go away******:Pain in musclesNauseaBurning or sensation of tightnessStomach upsetPrickling**Sleepiness**TinglingHeadacheSevere peripheral neuropathiesFlushing**Bloating**Blurred visionAbnormality in the upper chambers of heartVisual lossGastric irritationElevated serum aspartate transaminaseDiarrheaSkin rashCrampsSkin pigmentation disorderSkin disorderIndigestionVomitingGoutSevere skin itchingUpset stomach**Loss of appetite**Back pain**Dry mouth**Unpleasant tasteBad breathHeartburnGastrointestinal discomfortOdoriferous sweat****** * ********************************************************Here ""sleepiness"",""Loss of appetite"",""Dry mouth"" and ""Bloating"" are few of side effects which were also seen in my grandmother ,** ***** ***** **** *** **** ************ **** **** ********** ** ** ****** *** ********* ** ******** *** **** ***** *** *** **************** ***** ***** ******* ** ******* ************ *** ** ***** ******* ****** ***** *** *** ***** ************ ** ** **************** *** **** ** ******* ***** **** ******* **** ***** *** ****** **** ******** *** ***** *********** ** ***** ** ***** **** ****** *** *** ****** *** ***** * ***** ** **** ************ *** *** ******** ***** *** *** ******** **** *** ********* *** ****** **** ******* *** ******** ****** ",I do not recommend the doctor,Mumbai

Dr.Amit .P.Shah is an excellent physician. I consulted him a number of times regarding my dad's health problems which started with convulsions then pneumonia and later sepsis.

"Very poor diagnosis and procedure done on my mother. When we visited him in November, he had told us that the surgery can be avoided and to wait. However looking at my mothers pain, we went for surgery. He guided us to go for laser treatment and told us it is effective. Based on that, we got my mom operated in Hiranandani Hospital. Post operation, my mom was told that she could be normal and she could fly, walk and do anything she wants. However even after 1.5 months post operation, my mother's pain was unbearable. On meeting the DR, She was advised bed rest for a week. Even post that the pain was unbearable. Due to his busy schedule, Dr. Mhatre called her to Fortis hospital. There, she was made to wait for more than 2 hours post which Dr. Mhatre turned up. He directly sent her to dopler test where her tests were taken. The Dr. Testing her told her there are some perforations and marked it in her thighs and chaff muscles. Dr. Mhatre upon his arrival cut the other Dr. In the middle and says there is nothing and that she should visit a spine surgeon!! That is when my mom realized there is something fishy and his intentions were to just take money from us. MOST IMPORTANTLY - MY MOM WAS NOT GIVEN HER DOPLER REPORTS SAYING THAT IT WAS INTERNAL AND THAT SHE HAD NOT PAID FOR IT.. SHE INSISTED TO PAY DOUBLE yet the Dr. who tested it deleted her test reports.. I really want to sue Dr. Mhatre if guided well.. We took a second opinion in Vijaya Hospital Chennai.. it was found that there were various Blocks in the vein and Dr. Mhatre had not done the surgery well at all..

He is softspoken my boils got cured without any scars remaining & in my viral  fever when I was weak he visited my home & gave me medicine . He didint even let us carry his bag or drop him down.  Such a doctor is hard to find,I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"I had met an accident. I went to him to show my injuries and to ask if I need antibiotics or not. Doctor saab checked me achhe se and told me that I am fine and I do not need to unnecessarily take medicines. He could have easily given 2-3 painkillers and multi-vitamins to justify his fees. Instead, he asked me to NOT to pay the fees. First time in Mumbai I met a such a doctor. Otherwise, at times, I have been charged even for stepping into the clinic. PS: It was two days ago and my wounds have started to heal naturally. PS: While submitting I realized that I do not have a proof to visit as doctor saab did not give any medicine and neither he charged me a single rupee. But I had gone there.

He Diagnostic me and told me that I have iron deficiency and he suggested me to have an injection every alternate day for 16 days and after which I am totally fit thanks a lot to Dr R N Dalaal.

"Many doctors advised me liver transplantation which drove me into sadness most of the time. when my friend recommended Dr Jayant Barve, I realy got best experience as he told me there is no need of liver transplant. i am under his treatment since last 9 years.",I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"I had diarrhoea and hard stools/constipation issues for more than 6 months. Blood through hard stools was becoming common but then a few times I noticed blood in stools even with loose motions. Going to general physicians had not helped my case so I decided to go to a gastroenterologist. I decided to go to Dr. Barve at Lilavati Hospital because my dad had received treatment from him there over 10 years ago and had recommended him to me.The initial meeting with Dr.Barve was at Lilavati. We had to wait for a long time for the appointment because he was in the endoscopy room. Then instead of taking patients in order of their appointment/arrival times, he just took whoever barged in first. During the consultation, he kept yawning, took several other calls and looked disinterested but we assumed he might be tired since it was late in the evening. He suggested we get colonoscopy done and that too at his hospital in Juhu and that he would arrange the anaesthetist in advance for me. He charged us Rs.3000 for this visit.3 days later we called his Jewel Hospital and scheduled the colonoscopy for the next day. My husband even spoke to the doctor about this. I was told to stop eating solids at 6PM and drinking liquids at 4AM before the procedure which was to be at 11AM (since I was to be administered anaesthesia). I followed the directions, took the Peglec powder as recommended and had loose motions all night and the next morning. I stay an hour and a half away from his clinic so it was a big task to get to his clinic in my condition. We got there right before 11AM.There was no receptionist or anyone in the clinic for that matter on the ground floor. The chemist asked us to check upstairs where there was a nurse, a maid, a ward boy and some other guy (I think he said he was the MRD or something similar). When we told them we were there for the appointment, they said that they were unaware of it and the doctor would return at 5PM so we should wait until then. I am a diabetic and was asked not to take my medication and stay without food and water for 18 hours already and now they expected me to stay that way for another 6 hours even when we had an appointment.My husband called the doctor and he said he would be there by 3PM. When he asked about the anaesthetist, the doc responded as if this was the first time he was hearing about it, and all this while he kept yawning on the phone. I was apprehensive about doing the colonoscopy there after this but since my condition was not so good and I didn't want to repeat the fasting, we agreed to wait until 3. Then since I am a diabetic and needed anaesthesia later, the doc had asked the staff to start IV fluids for me. This is where things went further downhill.The nurse who had been eating biscuits until that point, just came in and asked me change clothes and to lie down on a cot in a room. The sheets on this cot and the pillow cover were filthy. There were mosquitoes and flies flying about. I still agreed and lay on the cot. Then she pricked my right hand at one place and did it wrong due to which my hand immediately swelled up. My family had asked to turn the tubelight on in the room so that it would be easier for her to do it right but she said it wasn't working. Then she tried pricking at another place on my right forearm and again couldn't get it right. Another dark black spot formed and it hurt really bad in both the places. This is when she called the ward boy and the MRD guy in.The ward boy held my left hand down, the MRD guy turned on the torch on his cellphone (yes, you read it right) and the nurse tried to find a place to prick me a third time. When my mom asked them about the tubelight again instead of using the mobile's torch, the ward boy climbed on a chair and finally managed to turn it on. Then they pricked me a third time. And all of this was done without either of them cleaning their hands or sanitising before handling the instruments or touching me. Even after pricking the third time, they couldn't get it right. I was in extreme pain because of all the pricking, hungry and lightheaded. I called my husband in before they could try pricking me a fourth time. My husband just asked them to wrap everything up and asked me to get dressed in my clothes so that we can leave. They asked him to pay for the IV fluid and needles which were used so he went and got the supplies from the chemist downstairs and gave them to the staff. I have never felt so glad to get out of a hospital. And we were told that the ground floor receptionist comes in at 11AM. It was past noon when we got out and the receptionist was still not in!Important takebacks:** *** ****** ** *** ******* ***** ******** *** ********* Yawning and answering multiple other calls during consultation with a patient is not done, especially when you can't maintain order in taking in your patients.2. If you ask a patient to come in at a particular time, and if you are not available, please have the courtesy to call and inform the patient of the change or have your staff call the patient well in advance.3. Please appoint competent staff in your hospital. The ground floor staff was absent and the first floor staff said they didn't know of the appointments because they did not go downstairs to communicate with the ground floor staff. 4. Teach the staff to learn sanitary practices and maintain hygiene throughout the hospital. Keeping soiled linen and not washing hands before going to a patient are just unacceptable.5. Last but not the least, try to incorporate an appointment system where the appointment reminders get sent to you, your staff and the patient. This way you can make a note of special needs like anaesthesia requirement and make cancellations and changes to the schedule if something else comes up.I would not have gone to this doctor if I had just read his reviews. I only went because my dad got treatment from him a long time ago. I will not recommend going to Dr.Barve, especially at Jewel Hospital. ",I do not recommend the doctor,Mumbai

I had to go back home and change my shirt before I went to work.Apart from this she gave me 4 tablets Amoxicillin & Potassium Clavulanic ***** ******* ** *** ******** ***** * ******* and more importantly, she asked me to pay 600 bucks for a very bad service!!!Let’s calculate the costs, her fee is 300, a tetanus injection costs 10 bucks and a 6 tablet strip of Amoxcillin & Potassium Clavulanic costs 98 bucks.So she should have charged me a maximum of 410 bucks.Genuinely, after such bad  service and absolute disregard for the patient’s well being, I realised I should have just gone to a hospital and paid a similar amount gotten a much better service.Anyone reading this review, I recommend that you don’t visit her.I’m not writing this review out of spite.

He appreciated the Ayurvedic steps that I was already taking and asked me to continue the same. Since I had already taken an over the counter antibiotic( which he wasn’t particularly happy about), he recommended I complete the course and if the fever persists, I must take paracetamol 500 (to a max of 3 times a day).

3. Hears the patient out, every minor worry and concern

It is found that he is follower of Ethics of medical profession.Because of him I am maintaining good health.Thanks.,I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"Visited Dr. Shinde today with my mom. Mom has been an arthritis patient for a long time. He is very patient, gives a proper hear to all the concerns raised by the patient. He has prescribed a set of medicines and tests. Let's see how that goes. Follow up visit after few weeks. ",I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"Dr. Sushan Shinde  listen my health problem patently including my life stile , He explained me cause and effect of the disease . What to do what not to do with  menu  for daily diet . He advise me to do exercise regularly with health diet  and taking medicines.
In stead of taking medicine as a food he advised to eat fruits and other healthy foods as a medicine as I explained him I don't like to take medicine .Without any diagnosis he has prescribed only 2 tablets . others are after getting test reports .
He advised  how to maintain your life style accordance  to age is the best thing I liked .

Less medicine cost and natural way of recovery is the very helpful to middle class income group like me .
I wish he maintain this spirit in his career and help poor people to recover from the common diabetics in a lower medical bill and  live  longer healthy life. Best part is doctor listen my all words with full concentration .

We pray God to help him to help the society.

His practical approach towards the treatment was something that I really admired. We followed a step by step process for the treatment as advised by him to ensure that my wife only takes the medicines which are absolutely necessary. He did not advise on the battery of medical tests as it usually happens and relied on clinical investigation as the first step in the treatment. He patiently explained why it happens and the role of each medicine that he was prescribing and future course of action to ensure it does not recur (Prevention is definitely better than cure!!). He was kind enough to come early on request and also checked with me regularly on my wife's recovery. Thank you so much Doctor!! ,I recommend the doctor,Mumbai

"Dr. vishaka was like a blessing in disguise.  I am a mother of a 10 month old  baby boy. when I conceived my son I was 57kg and at my full term I was 76kg. after delivery I became 70kg. for almost 7 months I didn't loose any weight inspite of exercising.  I reached a point of depression and started feeling very low, lost my self confidence and self esteem. my people around me would tell me things like now u wont be able to get back just be happy being a fat mother, accept ur new self. I couldn't take it anymore. that's when I decided that im going to prove all of them wrong. luckily at that point I met a girl who recommended dr vishaka. that's how I got cracking with my weight loss. Dr. Vishaka sat we me and very sweetly and calmly started my diet planning. Her forte is helping u stick to what u eat but by tweaking it a little bit to make the magic happen. Every week I would visit her and by the end of 3 months I lost 9.3kg. I can now fit into alll my clothes,  my friends around me are inspired  by my weight loss. I feel happy, positive, healthy and good about myself. My confidence is back I can't thank dr.Vishaka enough. I yet visit her coz i have another 6kg to loose which i know i will achieve in another 2 months. Dr.Vishaka is not only fantastic at her work but a very very nice person. Im so glad she has come into my life. So for all those people out there who want to experience a smooth and healthy weight loss Dr. Vishaka is the right person. ",I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
Actually I had gone for my weight loss and I'm super happy with the results. My husband is been seeing her for diabetes. She has been so far good. Just that hoping to get prompt reply at times when we are such since we don't consult anyone else. Doctors are all about faith and trust and we have faith in her and hence probably would be asking her questions which might be very small for her but we being at the receiving end we might find it big enough to ask her. I have been recommending her to many and will continue doing that. ,I recommend the doctor,Mumbai
"I am a big foodie and yet I look forward to meeting Dr. Vishakha every week. I think that speaks volumes about how she customises the diet to your lifestyle.I work as a consultant and have to travel through the week.

"I was completely distressed as was suffering from immense pain on the left side of my face. None of the doctors I had gone to (even some of the leading doctors and hospitals in Mira Road) could find the right diagnosis. I was treated for cavity, sinusitis, infection and so on. But the pain continued. That was when a friend recommended consulting Dr Prashant Upadhyay. He is a gem of a doctor and extremely down to earth. He patiently listened to my problem and suggested an MRI as he doubted Trigeminal Neuralgia. After TN was confirmed, he elaborately explained all about it and gave me the required medication. Ever since, though we shifted from Mira Road, my entire family visits only Dr Prashant Upadhyay for any ailment and will continue to do so.

It was a Sunday when all the clinics were shut and Dr. Raihan Motorwala came to my rescue.He attended me on a Sunday & suggested me to undergo few tests & as a mark of a true experienced professional his indications were absolutely correct & I was detected with dengue.Unlike usual doctors who would suggest you to get admitted. Dr. Motorwala dint do any of it.He prescribed few medicines & clearly told me that there are no medicinies as such &that the platelets counts would still go lower. That exactly happened with me. After a couple of days my health further deteriorated as the platelets count went further down. Dr. Motorwala then recommended me to get hospitalized.I got hospitalized and saw that Dr. Motorwala would religiously make two rounds; one in the morning &one in the evening.Also one more point of highlight he visits even on a Sunday. I have great respect for this doctor as he is amongst the very few Doctors today who considers service to mankind as his motto and truely enjoys in doing so without a complain and without a weekend off.Salute to Dr. Motorwala's spirit.Well the end of my story is that, I recovered soon under the medication of Mr. Motorwala.This doc has a good sense of humor & very down to earth personality.

"I called at 6:30 PM today and booked an appointment for 9PM. We waited for more than 1 and half hour and the doctor came after that. He explained the illness, took the X-ray and prescribed the medicines. Then, while paying the amount, he charged me Rs. 1000! I was confused, so I asked the receptionist of how much is the consulting fees for the doctor? She said normally Doctor takes 500 but then yours was an emergency case. He sits from 4-6 PM nah, so he came because you had an emergency. My face fell pale. I mean, like seriously? You make me wait for more than an hour, and then you charge me for being treated on an emergency basis. P.S. I have a 5 months old baby waiting for me at home.

Since his blisters were too severe, and I was in close contact with him, he insisted me to go to the doctor to get the immunisation for myself to avoid infection. I went to Sobit Hospital and met Dr Vidya or Dr Anita (a senior doctor).She heard me patiently and smiled and told me to take good care of my son and to go. She refused to give me any immunisation saying that since I had Chickenpox during my childhood I wouldn't require further immunisation. She refused to take any fee for the consultation even when I insisted. I was indeed surprised and touched by her gesture towards a total stranger! May her tribe increase. May God bless her.

"Visited the doctor as the recommendation of my endocrinologist
Went to Dr Sanghvi's clinic considering his experience, qualification and facilities
But overall experience was thoroughly disappointing. We were tried to be convinced that there could be some problem with the heart (on the basis of an over-priced ECG test) and it would be best to get admitted immediately
If not admitted, we were asked to get another series of tests done - which again, we felt we unnecessary since the endocrinologist had said to visit a cardiologist only for a cross-check that there is no heart problem
The next day we went to take a second opinion from another very senior doctor who told us that there was nothing to worry and everything was fine
Please take second (and even third, if necessary) opinions in these matters. You may avoid unnecessary trouble for yourself and the ailing person
